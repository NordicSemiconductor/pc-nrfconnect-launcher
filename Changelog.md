## Unreleased
### Changed
- Better reliability in China. The app list is not loaded from GitHub any
  longer but from developer.nordicsemi.com, which should be easier to reach

### Added

### Fixed
- Switching focus after selecting the `About` pane caused incorrect or missing
  details in `Application` card.
- Some disabled buttons (e.g. in the `About` pane) had no borders and were hard
  to see.
- Windows: Disconnected devices sometimes still showed up in the list of
  devices.
- Windows 11: Thingy:91 programming was broken by sporadic wakeups of the
  kernel.
- macOS: Thingy:91 detection broken when a nRF52 firmware version older than
  1.6.0 is used. In these cases, please upgrade to the latest firmware from the
  [Thingy:91 product page](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-91/Download).

  installed until the next start of the launcher.
- Make enumeration more robust in `nrf-device-lib-js`, which should reduce
  the frequency in which `EnumerateWorker json error` errors happen.
