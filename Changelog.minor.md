This Changelog collects changes which we consider not to be relevant enough for
the normal Changelog.md.

E.g. because the change is purely internal and so not visible to the users or
because it is so minor that the users will rarely care about them.

It is still helpful that we collect them, e.g. so that we can check them when
release the new version.

## Unreleased

### Added

-   #1147: Automatic release candidates.

### Changed

-   #1125: Handle specifying the core version of nrfutil.
-   #1133: Rewrote network code to use the fetch API.
-   #1134: Collected knowledge about Artifactory URL in central place.
-   #1149: Cleaned up the build workflows.
-   #1136: Disable signature verification on Windows.

### Fixed

-   #1116: Opening some files, e.g. log files, failed. E.g. on Windows and Linux
    with a space or on macOS with a semicolon in their names.
-   #1120: App windows used to increase in size on every launch.
-   #1122: Updated fs related code to not need fs-extra anymore.
-   #1123: Asynchronicity of `openFile` and `openUrl`.

## 5.2.0

### Added

-   #1066: Support for Artifactory tokens.

### Changed

-   #1101: Updated J-Link version to v8.18.
-   #1057: Show J-Link warning also for local apps.
-   #1063: Download J-Link from Artifactory.
-   #1071: Use `ExternalLink` from shared.
-   #1071: Simplified option passing in low-level net functions.
-   #1079: Switch from developer.nordicsemi.com to files.nordicsemi.com for all
    app downloads. Usage of sources from developer.nordicsemi.com is
    automatically migrated to files.nordicsemi.com on the first run.

    When running this version and then going back to an older version of the
    launcher, the older version will show apps installed from
    developer.nordicsemi.com as being withdrawn. But going forward to this
    version again, the app will look fine again.

-   #1080: If folks have one of the sources toolchain-manager, 3.8-release-test,
    neutrino-external, neutrino-internal, crasher, internal, or experimental,
    show a warning dialog that those were removed and suggest to also remove
    them locally.
-   #1082: Warn when adding sources from `developer.nordicsemi.com` and offer to
    instead add the corresponding source from `files.nordicsemi.com`.
-   #1083: Added dialogs about a required token for sources with a restricted
    access level, either when they come in through a migration from
    `developer.nordicsemi.com` or when they are added later.

### Fixed

-   #1058: Warning icon white background does not overlap outside of the parent
    boundaries.

## 5.1.0

### Fixed

-   #1037: Aligned "Update all apps" button with the list of the apps
    vertically.
-   #1051: `nrfutil` was always overwritten by the bundled version, even if the
    latter was older.

### Fixed

-   #989: Some strange source URLs could be handled wrong.

    [shared v146](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-shared/releases/tag/v146).
-   #935: Better message when installing downloadable apps fails.
-   #937: No quirky error message when invoking `nrfutil` fails in strange ways
    (from from
    [shared v150](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-shared/releases/tag/v150)).
-   #937: No error message on shutdown when e.g. an ongoing download still wants
    to send IPC messages.

-   #888: Add command line switch `--new-instance` to force opening a new
    instance of the launcher.
-   #891: Styling of the empty apps list state.

### Changed

-   #887, #899: Update build pipelines.
-   #893, #900, #902: Parse `package.json` from apps with `zod` and converted
    build scripts to TypeScript.
-   #894, #900, #901, #902: Telemetry events were changed and are now sent to

## 4.2.1

### Changed

    are loaded and loading updates on startup is disabled.

## 4.2.0

### Added

-   #861, #870: Support for `nrfutil`.
-   #874: IPC handler for safe storage.

### Changed

-   #850, #865: Support for a custom html-template from the app.

    If the app supplies an `nrfConnectForDesktop.html`-entry in `package.json`,
    this path will instead be used to load the app.

-   #844: Text is select when search field is focused, making it easier to
    replace the current text.

### Fixed

-   #851: Proxies with authentication were not handled correctly when multiple
    requests were done at the same time.
-   #852:
    -   Proxy dialogs were outdated.
    -   Multiple, partially misleading dialogs were displayed if users cancelled
        the proxy login.
-   #853:
    -   Add Source dialog:
        -   Trim leading and trailing whitespace from URL.
        -   Dialog style was outdated.
        -   More expressive error messages for typical errors: `source.json` not
            reachable at given URL, source already exists, or trying to add the
            official source.
    -   Name filter for apps: Trim leading and trailing whitespace.
-   #856: Fix shortcuts when different directories were specified.

    To reproduce:

    1. Determine an app (e.g. DTM) which is not installed when running the
       launcher normally, with default directories.
    1. Start the launcher with the options `--user-data-dir` and
       `--apps-root-dir`, e.g. on macOS with
       `--user-data-dir /tmp/nrf_data --apps-root-dir /tmp/nrf_apps`.
    1. The launcher open without any apps installed. Install one and create a
       shortcut to it.
    1. Open the shortcut.

    Previously the app didn't open, instead an error message was shown: “Error
    when starting application – Error: Tried to open app …, but it is not
    installed”. Now the app opens correctly.

### Removed

-   #867: Building the linux version with .tar.gz, now it's only AppImage, the
    only version released.

## 4.1.2

### Changed

-   #834: Send the IPC message `serialport:on-write` only after something was
    written to a serial port.
-   #840: Error dialogs now make it easier to understand if there are multiple
    errors and also can show technical details when a source fails to load.
-   #848: Bumped device-lib-js to 0.6.12.

### Removed

-   #839: Device-lib proxies.

### Fixed

-   #835: Wrong state for when users jumped between launcher versions.

    To reproduce:

    1. Remove the folder ~/.nrfconnect-apps (to start out with a clean,
       controlled state)
    1. Run the launcher 4.1.1. With it install the Programmer app and quit it.
    1. Run the launcher 4.0.1. With it uninstall Programmer and quit it.
    1. Run the launcher 4.1.1.

    Now the launcher showed the Programmer as seemingly installed again but
    launching or uninstalling it did not work.
