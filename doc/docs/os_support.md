??? info "Tier definitions"
    **Tier 1**: The tools will always work. The automated build and automated testing ensure that the tools build and successfully complete tests after each change.

    **Tier 2**: The tools will always build. The automated build ensures that the tools build successfully after each change. There is no guarantee that a build will work because the automation tests do not always run.

    **Tier 3**: The tools are supported by design, but are not built or tested after each change. Therefore, the application may or may not work.
