nRF Connect for Desktop is a cross-platform framework for desktop apps for
development kits and dongles from Nordic Semiconductor. The framework provides a
launcher and the general layout for selecting devices, navigation menus, and
logging, among others. Apps can decorate the standard components and use
built-in libraries in order to create end-user tools.
