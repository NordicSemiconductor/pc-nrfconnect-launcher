nRF Connect for Desktop is a cross-platform framework for desktop apps for
development kits or dongles from Nordic Semiconductor. The framework provides a
launcher and the general layout for selecting devices, navigation menus,
logging, etc. Apps can decorate the standard components and use built-in
libraries in order to create end-user tools.

## Supported Platforms

While it may vary in individual apps, nRF Connect for Desktop aims to support
all official Nordic Semiconductor development kits and dongles from these
series:

-   nRF51
-   nRF52
-   nRF53
-   nRF91

You can run nRF Connect for Desktop on:

-   Windows
-   Ubuntu Linux 64-bit
-   macOS

## Using nRF Connect for Desktop

### Prerequisites

#### macOS and Linux

J-Link driver needs to be separately installed on macOS and Linux. Download and
install it from [SEGGER](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink) under the
section _J-Link Software and Documentation Pack_. Without it when running the
apps you would otherwise get error messages when running the apps like
`CouldNotFindJprogDLL`, `CouldNotOpenDLL` or `JLINKARM_DLL_NOT_FOUND`.

##### Linux only

In order to access Nordic USB devices with correct permissions _udev_ rules need
to be set up once. For this purpose
[nrf-udev](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrf-udev) repository has been
created, follow instructions there.

### Installation

Download binaries from the
[nRF Connect for Desktop product page](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Connect-for-desktop)
on Nordic Semiconductor web pages.

### Running

When starting nRF Connect for Desktop a central launcher is shown. It enables
you to install, update and launch the individual apps. Currently provided by
Nordic Semiconductor are:

-   [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-ble)
-   [Power Profiler](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-ppk)
-   [Programmer](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-programmer)
-   [RSSI Viewer](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-rssi)
