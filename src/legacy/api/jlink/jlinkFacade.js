/**
 * Combines Windows registry lookup and connected serial numbers from nrfjprog
 * to uniquely identify serial numbers for SEGGER J-Link devices.
 *
 * On Windows, there are no APIs that give us the COM name <-> serial number
 * relation. We have to do a registry lookup to find J-Link IDs for COM names.
 * Unfortunately, the registry may contain multiple serial numbers for the same
 * COM name. This is because COM names may be reused over the course of time,
 * and then the registry will contain old numbers in addition to the current
 * serial number.
 *
 * When we are not able to identify the serial number only from the registry
 * alone, we filter out the serial numbers that are not in the list of connected
 * serial numbers from nrfjprog. Only doing the nrfjprog lookup if required,
 * in order to make it as fast as possible.
